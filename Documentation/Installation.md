# Installation

## Git

First of all you need to download this repository. Note that you need to have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) installed also. I assume you already have some git experience and won't focus on any details. Just clone repo wherever you want and continue to the next step.

## Unity

You need to install the Unity Editor `2022.3.21f1`.
Simplest way is to download it from Unity Hub from [unity's website](https://unity.com/download).

After you have installed Unity Hub, you need to open it and sign in.

The process is streamlined so I won't go into details here.
Next in installs tab you need to install Unity. Open Unity Hub and select `Install` section.

Then click install editor and click install near `2022.3.21f1`.

Uncheck all the boxes, you wan't need them.

Wait for download to finish and continue to the next step.

## Open project

I highly suggest you to read through [Unity overview](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html) to get familiar with Unity. You can ask me questions anytime, if you need help.

First you need to add project to Unity Hub.

Then it will appear at Projects tab. Click on it to start.

Next find your [project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html). There in the `Scenes` folder you will find EntryPoint scene. Double click on it to open.
